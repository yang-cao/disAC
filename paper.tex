\begin{abstract}
  This paper studies schema selection for key-value (KV) stores
  \warn{under the new block as a value (\baav) model that
  take} a key and fetch a block of values as a whole, rather
  than fetching a single tuple at a time.
  We consider parametric \SQL queries over KV
  stores, as commonly found in e-commerce. For such queries,
  we identify \warn{novel criteria, namely scan-free evaluability and
  degree minimization for selecting \baav schemas,
  to avoid scans and speed up data fetching.}
  %and minimize space overhead and reduce %incremental
  %update maintenance cost.
  We formalize the schema selection problem under these criteria,
  and show its \NP-completeness. Despite the intractability, 
  we develop practical algorithms by means of integer linear
  programming that can reason about \baav schemas and queries,
  to select a schema that guarantees
  certain optimality under practical conditions.
  Using standard %real-life and
  benchmarks,
  we experimentally verify the
  effectiveness of the selected schema and the efficiency of the
  selection algorithm.
