We have identified, formulated and studied the \baav schema selection
problem for \kv stores. We have proposed a normal form for \baav schemas,
and come up with an aggregate rank function based on %four
practical
criteria. We have shown that the schema selection problem is
\NP-complete. Despite the intractability, we have developed
efficient algorithms for selecting \baav schema while warranting
optimality under practical conditions. Our experimental studied
has verified that the method is practical, as indicated by
the effectiveness of the \baav schema selected
and the efficiency of the algorithms.\looseness=-1

One topic for future work is to learn coefficients of the aggregate
rank function (Section~\ref{sec-rank}) possibly by employing
machine
learning models. Another topic is to extend the study to
support multiple query loads that run on the same \kv store at the same time.
%A third topic is to implement the framework of Section~\ref{sec-schema}
%to support parametric queries, based on algorithms for
%schema selection and incremental maintenance of this paper
%and the query plan generation algorithms of~\cite{VLDB19}.\looseness=-1
